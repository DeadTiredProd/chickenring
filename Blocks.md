Raw chicken blocks will decay over time eventually turning them into Rotting chicken blocks.  
To avoid bacterial contamination they must be stored within an inventory or a snow biome.

Raw chicken will also rot if left exposed to the elements.

Frozen raw chicken blocks will thaw over time eventually turning back into raw chicken blocks.

Rotting chicken blocks are the decayed version of raw chicken blocks.  They currently serve no purpose other than a neat effect and a way to store rotting chicken easily. A plan to use them is already brewing.
