# Blocks 

This mod adds a few new blocks / recipes / items and functionality.

# Raw Chicken Block

Raw chicken blocks will decay over time eventually turning them into Rotting chicken blocks. 
To avoid bacterial contamination they must be stored within an inventory or a snow biome.

Raw chicken will also rot if left exposed to the elements. 

# Frozen Raw Chicken Block

Frozen raw chicken blocks will thaw over time eventually turning back into raw chicken blocks.
