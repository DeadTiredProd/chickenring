# Blocks

This mod adds a few new blocks / recipes / items and functionality.

# Raw Chicken Block

![raw_chicken_block_recipe_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/recipes/raw_chicken_block_recipe_preview.png)

Raw chicken blocks will decay over time eventually turning them into Rotting chicken blocks.  
To avoid bacterial contamination they must be stored within an inventory or a snow biome.

Raw chicken will also rot if left exposed to the elements.

# Frozen Raw Chicken Block

![frozen_raw_chicken_block_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/previews/frozen_raw_chicken_block_preview.png)  
![frozen_raw_chicken_block_recipe_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/recipes/frozen_raw_chicken_block_recipe_preview.png)

Frozen raw chicken blocks will thaw over time eventually turning back into raw chicken blocks.  
They can be obtained through crafting or through normal environmental changes.

(Currently not implemented - Meat Freezer)

# Cooked Chicken Block

![cooked_chicken_block_recipe_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/recipes/cooked_chicken_block_recipe_preview.png)

Cooked chicken blocks can be obtained by crafting them like you would a diamond block (using x9 cooked chicken).  

(Smelting not implemented)

# Frozen Cooked Chicken Block

![frozen_cooked_chicken_block_recipe_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/recipes/frozen_cooked_chicken_block_recipe_preview.png)

Frozen cooked chicken blocks are like cooked chicken blocks but they have been frozen after being cooked.  
They can be obtained through crafting or world interaction.

# Rotting Chicken Block

![rotting_chicken_block_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/previews/rotting_chicken_block_preview.png)  
![rotting_chicken_block_recipe_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/recipes/rotting_chicken_block_recipe_preview.png)

Rotting chicken blocks are the decayed version of raw chicken blocks.  
They currently serve no purpose other than a neat effect and a way to store rotting chicken easily. A plan to use them is already brewing.

# Frozen Rotting Chicken Block (Added - V1.0.8)

![frozen_rotting_chicken_block_preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeadTiredProd/chickenring/main/images/previews/frozen_rotting_chicken_block_preview.png)
